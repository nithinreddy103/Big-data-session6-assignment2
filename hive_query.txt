1.Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than
300000 and less than 399999.

select date,temperature from temperature_data where(zipcode BETWEEN '300000' AND '399999');

2. Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data
table.

select substr(date,7,10),MAX(temperature) from temperature_data group by substr(date,7,10);

3.Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those
years which have at least 2 entries in the table.

select substr(date,7,10),MAX(temperature) from temperature_data group by substr(date,7,10) having count(substr(date,7,10))>2; 

4.Create a view on the top of last query, name it temperature_data_vw.

crete view temperature_data_vw as select substr(date,7,10),MAX(temperature) from temperature_data group by substr(date,7,10) having 
count(substr(date,7,10))>2; 

5.Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each
file is '|' delimited.

INSET OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/acadgild/Downloads' ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' 
select * from temperature_data_v;
